# Kill-Process
Have you ever done the following?
  1. Used "ps", "pgrep", or some other UNIX command to obtain a process's PID
  2. Used "kill -9" to kill the process
  3. Repeated steps 1-2 *every time* a new instance of the process was made
  
  
Stop the madness with this simple script, which can kill any one-word process by name. 

Usage:

`python kill-process [processName]`


Easy!
