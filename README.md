# Kill-Process
Have you ever done the following?
  1. Used "ps", "pgrep", or some other UNIX command to obtain a process's PID
  2. Used "kill -9" to kill the above process
  3. Repeat steps 1-2 *every time* a new instance of the process is made
  
Stop the madness with this simple script, which can kill any one-word process by name. Its usage is outlined below:

`python kill-process processName`

Easy!
